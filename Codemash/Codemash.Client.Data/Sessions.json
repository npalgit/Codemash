[{"SessionId":186,"Title":"SQL Server Internals","Abstract":"There's a lot of information about SQL Server's inner workings. Much of the material is highly focused and highly specialized. Before diving deep into the secrets of a particular feature, it's important to understand how all of the pieces of SQL Server work together. During this session we'll journey from the query parser to the storage engine and talk about how the different parts of SQL Server interact. Along the way we'll will cover theoretical and practical knowledge about databases and SQL Server in specific. Although there is a lot of theoretical and esoteric knowledge available, this presentation will focus on the practical and immediate Ã¢â‚¬â€œ wherever possible knowledge of SQL Server's internals will be related improving to real world performance.","Level":"Advanced","Track":"Database Platforms and Development","Room":"Conv.

{"SessionId":285,"Title":"WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s New in Windows Azure","Abstract":"Technology providers move at \"cloud speed\". Cloud computing platforms such as Windows Azure are updated more frequently than other technology platforms. The rapid pace of innovation makes it difficult to understand what features are available, and how to best utilize them in our applications. The positive aspect to the rapid updates is being able to quickly take advantage of new features and innovations. The Windows Azure platform is constantly growing and evolving. In this session we will take a quick look back at major milestones in Windows Azure's relatively brief history, and then proceed into reviewing recent platform updates and new features now available. Coming away you will have a solid understanding of Windows Azure platform features available for you to use in your applications today.","Level":"Beginner","Track":"Cloud","Room":"Conv.

{"SessionId":267,"Title":"A Sneak Peek of Visual Studio 11 ","Abstract":"Microsoft's application lifecycle management tooling is all about enabling teams to deliver great software. In this demo-packed session, you will learn how to more effectively plan and track work by using the new Web-based project management tools; how to bridge the divide between development and operations by utilizing IntelliTrace in your production environments; and how to help keep team members on-task and 'in the zone', no matter how much there're randomized. See a tour of the new \"My Work\" and code review features. In addition to making your team more productive, we will show you how you can boost your overall code quality with new features such as code clone and an overhauled unit testing story in Visual Studio 11. With Team Foundation Server 11 you will see the full gamut of collaboration improvements, from the newly revamped Team Explorer, to the version control & build improvements.

{"SessionId":278,"Title":"Advanced SharePoint Web Part Development","Abstract":"Web Parts are the foundation of user interfaces in SharePoint. As a developer it's relatively easy (particularly with the Visual Web Part) to build something simple and get it deployed. But what do you do when you need to add editable properties or when you need to connect two Web Parts together? This fast-paced, demo-heavy session covers the more advanced aspects of building Web Parts for SharePoint 2010. We'll take a look at creating custom editor parts, building Visual Web Parts, constructing connected Web Parts, and how to render Web Parts asynchronously.","Level":"Advanced","Track":"Sharepoint","Room":"Conv.
