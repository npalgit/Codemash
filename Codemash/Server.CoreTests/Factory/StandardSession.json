[{"SessionId":343,"Title":"Programming Style and Your Brain","Abstract":"Computer programs are the most complicated things that humans make. They must be perfect, which is hard for us because we are not perfect. Programming is thought to be a \"head\" activity, but there is a lot of \"gut\" involved. Indeed, it may be the gut that gives us the insight necessary for solving hard problems. But gut messes us up when it come to matters of style.","Level":"General","Track":"Keynote","Room":"Conv. Ctr.

Windows 8 is coming, and it has a completely new API. In addition to the familiar Win32, developers can now take advantage of WinRT to participate in the Metro experience. Just about every operation in WinRT is asynchronous. And not just web calls. Even opening a file is an async operation. Arm yourself with the latest tools in .NET 4.5 -- the async and await keywords -- to take full advantage of the platform.","Level":"Intermediate","Track":"Platforms and Tools","Room":"Conv.

Go seeks to combine the best features of static and dynamic languages while giving developers a familiar but streamlined C-style syntax. Go also offers the speed of a compiled language without the technical overhead of C and C++. Another goal of Go is concurrency support with the multi-core processors found in today's systems. Currently, Go is one of the languages that can be used to develop applications with Google App Engine. This presentation will focus on Go language features and how they tie in to modern accepted best practices.","Level":"Intermediate","Track":"Open","Room":"Conv.
